# ChatApp
Chat App project using Spring Boot

This is a rudimentary web app that is similar to a chatroom. 
A user can sign up and then login afterwards to type in a message. 
They are able to select if the typed in message should be displayed in capital letters, small letters or just the way it is being typed.
The selection of the Shout mode would ensure the typed in message is displayed in capital letters.
The selection of the Whisper mode would ensure the typed in message is displayed in lower letters.
The selection of the Say mode would ensure the typed in message is displayed as typed in by user.
The app ensures that when the multiple users can see each others messages.
